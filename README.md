## Why I choose to do this project at this time?
Personal I was doing this kind of work at the very beginning of my front-end learning journey, and every time it ended up with nothing. Recently I read an article from freeCodeCamp weekly email, which I used to ignore it. The link is here: [How to Get Your First Dev Job – Insights from Reviewing Career Switchers' Résumés](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-your-first-dev-job/).

From this article, I learned *atomic commit* for the first time, it refreshed my understanding of commit, more importantly, I realized the importance of communication.
For a long time, I feel lost and discouraged when I learning and coding, I feel anxious. From today, I will practice writing in English, calm down, and don't be impetuous.
## Plan?
I still feel confused and lost, maybe I should start small, step by step, learn and consolidate my foundation and gradually regain my confidence.
